# IEEE VIS 2020 Discord Guide

Discord is a chat platform similar to Slack. The server contains a set
of channels, which can be grouped into categories. These are shown in
the UI panel to the left, as in the picture below.

**Figure 1:** Discord's User Interface. Channels are shown to the
left, those with a \# icon (a) are text channels, those with a speaker
icon (b) are voice chat channels. Users on the server are shown to the
left. (c) Channels are grouped into categories by event. (d) The
microphone icone is used to mute or unmute yourself, the headset icon is
used to deafen (silence incoming voice chat) or undeafen yourself. (e)
is the input for the chat.

## Channels for Conference Sessions

A category is created for each conference event (e.g., associated
events, workshops, full papers, short papers), and a channel within this
category for each session of the event. These channels are created as
the conference takes place. Thus on Sunday, the channel list will only
show channels for events on Sunday. On Monday, the channel list will
contain channels for all events taking place on Sunday and Monday, and
so on through the week. Each event also has a "general" channel which
can be used for general chat related to the event. When the session is
live, the Discord Channel and YouTube chats will be synchronized using a
bot. Messages from YouTube will be prefixed with (YouTube). Similarly,
on YouTube messages from Discord are prefixed (Discord).

## Navigation

Select the channel you want to join in the channels list. You can
minimize categories you don't want to see by clicking the toggle arrow
to the left of the category name (c). If you have unread messages in the
category, those channels won't be hidden. To hide a category with unread
messages you can right click it, as shown in Figure 2, and select mute
for the period you want.

## Voice Chat

Join a voice channel by clicking the voice channel name. You can be in
a voice channel and text channel at the same time, as shown in Figure 4.
The voice channel you are currently in will be shown by your username
appearing within it (a), and the name will be shown above your audio
controls (b). To disconnect from the voice channel, click the
"Disconnect" icon shown next to your profile in the voice channel
controls box (b). You can also click the channel name a second time to
enter the channel for video. If video is enabled you could then turn on
your camera.

**Figure 5:** After clicking the voice chat channel name a second
time, you will enter it for video chat.

## Using the Poll Bot

When a session is live, there will be a bot active in the channels for
each live event. This bot can be used to create and vote on polls as a
mode for Q&A. This can help if multiple people have the same question,
instead of repeatedly asking it, you can ask it once on the poll and
vote it up. The poll bot will print instructions in each channel
associated with a live stream

Figure 6: Poll bot usage instructions. Shortly after the bot
prints "The Session is Starting" to the chat, the polling system is
active. The poll system ends when the bot prints "The Session has Ended"
to the chat. You can type "\$help" when the bot is active to print the
above help information

## Conference Session Schedules

The schedule for each session will also be printed out to the session,
with the session schedule and a link to the YouTube live stream.

## Accessing Pinned Messages

Both the poll bot help and conference session are pinned to the
channel's messages. You can access these at anytime by clicking the pin
icon in the upper right, circled below.
