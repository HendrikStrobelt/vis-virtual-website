### Acknowledgements

The IEEE VIS 2020 Virtual site was adapted from the MiniConf software by the [IEEE VIS 2020 website, technology, and archive commmittees](http://ieeevis.org/year/2020/info/committees/conference-committee) with content input from [all conference committees](http://ieeevis.org/year/2020/info/committees/conference-committee).  MiniConf was originally built by [Hendrik Strobelt](http://twitter.com/hen_str) and [Sasha Rush](http://twitter.com/srush_nlp); you can find [the open-source implementation on GitHub](https://github.com/Mini-Conf/Mini-Conf).

We welcome your comments about your experience and anything we can do to make your virtual experience better.  Please join us in #support or #suggestions on Discord, or feel free to e-mail the committees directly.
