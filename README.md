### Acknowledgements

The IEEE VIS 2020 Virtual site was adapted from the MiniConf software by the [IEEE VIS 2020 website, technology, and archive commmittees](http://ieeevis.org/year/2020/info/committees/conference-committee) with content input from [all conference committees](http://ieeevis.org/year/2020/info/committees/conference-committee).

MiniConf was originally built by [Hendrik Strobelt](http://twitter.com/hen_str) and [Sasha Rush](http://twitter.com/srush_nlp); you can find [the original open-source implementation on GitHub](https://github.com/Mini-Conf/Mini-Conf), and [our fork as well](https://github.com/ieee-vgtc/vis-virtual-website) (which will become public after the conclusion of the conference).

We welcome your comments about your experience and anything we can do to make your virtual experience better.  Please join us in #support or #suggestions on Discord, or feel free to e-mail the committees directly.
