## Welcome to VIS 2020 Virtual!

Example intro text.

### Authentication

You need to authenticate with our website to access the session listings, download content, and see organized listing of live events.  To register, please visit [http://ieeevis.org/](http://ieeevis.org/year/2020/info/registration/conference-registration).

You should receive an e-mail with an auto-generated password to the e-mail you used to register for the conference.  If you didn't receive the e-mail, please check your spam folder.  The e-mails are sent from the auth0.com domain.  If you are still having trouble, please ask in #support in Discord or e-mail web@ieeevis.org.


## Content availablity

With any registration (free or otherwise), you are welcome to access all authenticated content in the conference!  This includes direct links to pre-recorded content, paper PDFs, as well as access to live panels and Q&amp;A sessions.

Paper artefacts linked from this website (e.g., direct links to PDFs) will be removed approximately a week following the conference, as negotiated with IEEE.

If you registered to receive the full conference materials, a secured URI of these materials will be e-mailed to the e-mail you registered with.

## Time zones

All times are converted to your auto-detected timezone (as reported by your browser). If you wish to view times in a different time zone, please select a timezone in the dropdown on [the Schedule page](/calendar.html).  Each page reports the currently-displayed timezone in the footer in relation to GMT.


### Help

Feel free to visit [our Help page above](/help.html), where we also have a short tutorial on using Discord.  If you are still having issues, feel free to ask in #support in Discord or e-mail web@ieeevis.org.

### Privacy

Our virtual conference website does not collect any personal information, nor does our web server track requests made from individual clients.

We use browser local storage for ensuring all dates and times are shown in your set timezone.  We also use cookies to record your viewing history of papers on the papers page.  These are entirely for your benefit and none of this data is trasmitted from your browser to us.

We use [auth0](https://auth0.com/) for authentication, [Discord](https://discord.com/) for live chat, and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) for viewing livestreams, who may handle your personal data (i.e., e-mail address) based upon their privacy policies.  If you have a data request or any questions, please e-mail [web@ieeevis.org](mailto:web@ieeevis.org).
