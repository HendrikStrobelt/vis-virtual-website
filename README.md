## Welcome to VIS 2020 Virtual!

Example intro text.

### Authentication

You need to authenticate with our website to access the session listings, download content, and see organized listing of live events.  To register, please visit [http://ieeevis.org/](http://ieeevis.org/year/2020/info/registration/conference-registration).

You should receive an e-mail with an auto-generated password to the e-mail you used to register for the conference.  If you didn't receive the e-mail, please check your spam folder.  The e-mails are sent from the auth0.com domain.  If you are still having trouble, please ask in #support in Discord or e-mail web@ieeevis.org.


## Content availablity

With any registration (free or otherwise), you are welcome to access all authenticated content in the conference!  This includes direct links to pre-recorded content, paper PDFs, as well as access to live panels and Q&amp;A sessions.

Paper artefacts linked from this website (e.g., direct links to PDFs) will be removed approximately a week following the conference, as negotiated with IEEE.

If you registered to receive the full conference materials, a secured URI of these materials will be e-mailed to the e-mail you registered with.

## Time zones

All times are converted to your auto-detected timezone (as reported by your browser). If you wish to view times in a different time zone, please select a timezone in the dropdown on [the Schedule page](/calendar.html).  Each page reports the currently-displayed timezone in the footer in relation to GMT.

### Acknowledgements

The IEEE VIS 2020 Virtual site was adapted from the MiniConf software by the [IEEE VIS 2020 website, technology, and archive commmittees](http://ieeevis.org/year/2020/info/committees/conference-committee) with content input from [all conference committees](http://ieeevis.org/year/2020/info/committees/conference-committee).  MiniConf was originally built by [Hendrik Strobelt](http://twitter.com/hen_str) and [Sasha Rush](http://twitter.com/srush_nlp); you can find [the open-source implementation on GitHub](https://github.com/Mini-Conf/Mini-Conf).

We welcome your comments about your experience and anything we can do to make your virtual experience better.  Please join us in #support or #suggestions on Discord, or feel free to e-mail the committees directly.
